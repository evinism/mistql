# MistQL Rust Implementation

This is the Rust implementation of MistQL, a miniature query language for performing computations on JSON-like structures. It's designed for embedding across multiple domains and serves as a powerful common expression language with strong cross-platform behavior semantics.

## Project Status

🚧 **MVP Complete - Core Infrastructure Ready** - The basic MistQL infrastructure is working with a comprehensive test suite.

**Current Status**:
- [x] **Core Architecture**: Lexer, Parser, Executor, Type System.
- [x] **Test Framework**: ~7/514 assertions in the test suite are failing.
- [x] **Basic Query Function**: Main API working.
- [x] **Builtin Functions**: Most functions need implementation (see TODO list below)
- [ ] **Refactor**: Carefully read the LLM-assisted port and refactor it.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Tasks 8-12)

- [x] **Built-in Functions** - Implement all 40+ built-in functions (array, object, string, mathematical, utility operations)
- [ ] **Instance Management** - Implement MistQLInstance for custom functions and parameterized instances
- [ ] **Type Boundaries** - Implement type conversion between Rust and MistQL types (serde integration, special handling for Option<T>, DateTime, etc.)
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Implement custom error types and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **CLI Interface** - Implement command-line interface with JSON/JSONL support and pretty printing

### Phase 3: Quality & Compatibility (Tasks 13-16)

- [x] **Testing Integration** - Integrate with shared test suite and implement Rust-specific tests
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for performance and memory efficiency, benchmark against JS/Python implementations
- [ ] **Documentation** - Create Rust-specific documentation and usage examples
- [ ] **Cross-platform Validation** - Validate cross-platform compatibility with JavaScript and Python implementations

## Quick Start

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run the full shared test suite
cargo test test_shared_suite -- --nocapture

# Run all tests
cargo test
```

## Key Technical Considerations

### Type Safety
- Rust's type system should provide better compile-time guarantees than Python's runtime checking
- Zero-copy JSON parsing where possible
- Efficient string handling with minimal allocations

### Performance
- Significant performance improvements over Python expected
- Memory-efficient immutable runtime values with reference sharing
- Lazy evaluation for expressions

### Cross-platform Compatibility
- Must pass all shared tests from `/shared` directory
- Identical behavior semantics with JavaScript and Python implementations
- Same API surface as Python implementation

## Target API

```rust
use mistql::query;

// Basic usage
let data = serde_json::json!([{"name": "John", "age": 30}, {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}]);
let result = query("filter age > 26 | map name", &data)?;

// Custom functions
use mistql::MistQLInstance;
let instance = MistQLInstance::new()
    .with_custom_function("custom_sum", |a, b| a + b);
let result = instance.query("custom_sum 1 2", &serde_json::Value::Null)?;
```

## MistQL Language Features

### Core Types
- **8 Core Types**: null, boolean, number, string, object, array, function, regex
- **Type Conversion**: Automatic conversion between Rust and MistQL types
- **Special Handling**: `Option<T>` → `null`, `DateTime` → ISO strings

### Syntax Features
- **Contextualized Expressions**: `@` variable changes context in iterations
- **Piping**: Clean function chaining syntax (`data | filter condition | map field`)
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and regex matching
- **Indexing**: Dot notation, bracket notation, array/string indexing with negative indices and slicing

### Built-in Functions (40+)
- **Array Operations**: count, filter, map, find, reduce, sort, reverse, flatten, withindices
- **Object Operations**: keys, values, entries, fromentries, mapkeys, mapvalues, filterkeys, filtervalues
- **String Operations**: split, stringjoin, replace, match, regex
- **Mathematical**: sum, summarize, range
- **Utility**: if, log, apply, string, float

## Contributing

This implementation follows the same patterns as the existing JavaScript and Python implementations. Key principles:

1. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: All implementations must behave identically
2. **Shared Test Suite**: Must pass all tests in `/shared` directory
3. **Performance**: Rust implementation should be significantly faster than Python
4. **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
