# Syntax Overview

While MistQL's syntactic footprint is kept relatively small, it does take a little time to get used to. 

## Initial Context
The simplest query in MistQL is `@`, which simply returns the _data_ passed in back. `@` refers to the current context, which initially is set to _data_, making `@` the identity query in MistQL.

The keys of the current context `@` are populated in the namespace as variables. For example, if the _data_ object is `{ "foo": "bar" }`, the query `foo` returns `"bar"`, as the variable `foo` has been populated in the namespace.

## Basic Operators
MistQL supports basic numbers and arithmetic expressions. For example, the expression `1 + 5` returns the number `6`. A more complicated expression might look like `10.5 * (30 % 7) - 5 / 8`.

MistQL also allows basic logical operations. The expression `true && false` outputs `false`, and `!false` outputs `true`. Finally, MistQL supports standard comparisons and equivalences: `50 > 10` outputs `false`, `10 > 50` outputs `false`, and `10 == 10` outputs `true`. For precise equality semantics, please refer to the Types section of the docs site. 

## Literals
JSON literals are all valid MistQL. For example the expression `{ "foo": 1, "bar": "baz" }` would return `{ "foo": 1, "bar": "baz" }`, regardless of whatever data was provided.

JSON literals can contain complicated subexpressions, for example the expression `[2 * 3, 5 * 10, { "food": "hot" +"dog"}]` evaluates to `[6, 50, {"food": "hotdog"}]`.

## Accessing Fields on Objects
There are 2 main ways of accessing a field on an object in MistQL, namely *Bracket Notation* and *Dot Notation*.

### Bracket Notation
Accessing fields on objects in MistQL is similar to JavaScript. To access fields on objects in MistQL, you use index notation with square brackets using strings. For example, if `@` is `{"hello": "world"}`, then the query `@["hello"]` returns the string `"world"`.

### Dot Notation
If the name of the key on an object is alphanumeric, you can use dot notation to access object keys as well. For example, given data of `{"foo": "bar"}`, you can validly rewrite `@["foo"]` as `@.foo`. Nested object can be accessed as a series of dots, e.g. the query `@.foo.bar.baz` over data `{"foo": {"bar": {"baz": 5}}}` yields `5`, as expected.

Accessing fields on objects is _null coalescing by default_: if you access missing keys on an object `@.these.keys.dont.exist`, the expression will evaluate to `null` without erroring out.

## Accessing strings and arrays

Strings and arrays are accessed exclusively by *bracket notation* using zero-indexed numbers:

```
"hello"[0] == "h"
"hello"[4] == "o"
[100, 200, 300, 400][0] == 100
[100, 200, 300, 400][3] == 400
```

Using negative numbers allows indexing from the end of a string or array:

```
"world"[-1] == "d"
"world"[-2] == "l"
[100, 200, 300, 400][0] == 100
[100, 200, 300, 400][3] == 400
```

Additionally, you can use the `:` separator in a pythonic style to allow for selecting of ranges:

```
"china"[1:] == "hina"
"spain"[:-2] == "spa"
"portugal"[1:4] == "ort"
```

Similarly, we get the following for arrays:

```
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50][3:] == [40, 50]
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50][:2] == [10, 20]
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50][1:-1] == [20, 30, 40]
```

## Calling Functions
Functions in MistQL are called in a lisp-like syntax, with function name and arguments separated by whitespace:

```
functionname argument1 argument2 argument3
```

For example, the following query sorts the provided array using the single-argument function `sort`:

`sort [1, 5, 3]` results in the array `[1, 3, 5]`

Multi-argument functions follow the same pattern. For example, the following calls the `index` function using 3 arguments, namely `1`, `3`, and `"foobar"`:

```
index 1 3 "foobar"
```

#### Caveat: Function arguments can look quite complicated
Function arguments can be bare expressions. For example, take the following (fairly hard to read) expression:

```
index 54 * 2 1 - 3 / 5 @
```

In the above expression, `index` is taking 3 arguments:
* `54 * 2`
* `1 - 3 / 5`
* `@`
We can make this fact more clear by putting parentheses around each of the arguments. Putting explicit parentheses yields the following:

```
index (54 * 2) (1 - 3 / 5) (@)
```

## Piping
Piping provides an easy way to pass the result from one function along to another function in a clean, readable manner. When an expression is piped, the result of the expression on the left-hand side of the pipe is passed as the last argument to the function on the right-hand side of the pipe.

For example, these two queries behave identically:
```
split "," "dog,cat,walrus"
"dog,cat,walrus" | split ","
```

This allows users to chain together a sequence of functions in an easy-to-read manner:

```
events | filter type == "purchase" | groupby email | keys
```

MistQL's standard library is built around enabling piping as often as possible. If something can be expressed with pipes, itâ€™s generally clearer to do so.

#### The `apply` idiom

You may be tempted to write the following to multiply 10 and 2:

```
10 | @ * 2         WRONG
```
This will error out, saying that the result of @ + 2 is not a function -- and it's right! Since piping relies on being able to pass functions in without arguments, allowing the above syntax would form an ambiguity:



```
10 | @ * 2         WRONG
10 | apply @ * 2   RIGHT
```

## Contextualized Expressions
Contextualized expressions form the core of what differentiate MistQL from many other languages, and so should not be ignored. Contextualized Expressions are MistQL's standin for what would be lambdas in other languages.

When calculating the result of a function, MistQL often executes expressions multiple times under different contexts. For example, in the following code, the expression `@ % 2 == 0` is run multiple times: For each element in the array, filter appends the @ variable (along with any properties of that variable) to the stack, and executes the first expression.

`filter (@%2 == 0) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` results in `[2, 4, 6]`

The function calling the expression dictates how context is supplied to that expression, and how to handle the result of the expression. Functions that push to the context stack in this way are notated as `@: SomeContextType -> SomeReturnType` in the documentation.

As always, variables defined on the `@` variable are populated into scope. In the below, since @ is set to each element of the array in turn, the variable `foo` evaluates to the `foo` key of each array element in turn.

```
(map (foo + 1) [{"num": 10}, {"num": 20}])) == [11, 21]
```

Having contextualized expressions in this manner allows for some very clean-looking syntax. For example, filtering for all events of a given type and mapping to their email can be done with the following:

`events | filter type == "page_shown" | map email`

In the above query, we first filter for all events where `event.type`  is "page_shown", then map to the email field on each event in turn.

## The Root Variable `$`
[ todo: This section is sketched out a little bit, but not much. ]

The root variable `$` is an object containing all of the following:
* A list of all builtin functions in MistQL
* A reference to the root context variable (denoted `@`)

### Method overwriting
In many cases, there can be naming conflicts 

Example: `{ "map": [] }`. What does query `map` resolve to?

Answer: it resolves to [], as the `map` function is overwritten.

In order to get back to the root, we have to reference an un-overwritable variable, namely the $ variable. 
Root Context
In several cases, context can be overwritten in such a way that you need a convenient way
