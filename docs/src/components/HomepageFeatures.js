          <h2 className="text--center">Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            MistQL originated as a domain specific language for machine learning
            feature extraction on the frontend. Despite the widespread
            proliferation of learned features in neural networks, the need for
            handcrafted features still provides immense value in situations
            where classical machine learning models are more appropriate. MistQL
            was purpose-built to fill the niche of a domain specific language
            for feature extraction on the frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this initial motivation, MistQL is far more general than
            simply clientside feature extraction. MistQL can be used in a wide
            range of applications, including, but not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>User-submitted or untrusted logic</li>
              <li>
                Shared backend / frontend logic in scenarios where sharing code
                is infeasable
              </li>
              <li>As a serializable storage format for pure functions</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

            How MistQL stacks up against other solutions
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text--center">JMESPath</h3>
          <p>
            JMESPath and MistQL are similar in scope, but MistQL provides more
            out of the box, including arithmetic operations and regexes. A goal
            of MistQL is to not simply be a query language, but a language for
            defining a broad set of computations on a JSON-like object. One of 
            the major driving factors behind MistQL is the fact that JMESPath 
            isn't able to capture many of the key operations that MistQL provides.
          </p>
          <p>
            JMESPath, however, has excellent cross-language support, whereas
            MistQL (for the time being) does not. If cross-language support is
            important, JMESPath might be your best bet, as MistQL only supports
            Python and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text--center">JSONLogic</h3>
          <p>
            JSONLogic is much smaller than MistQL, but also much less
            expressive. If the shared logic is extremely simple, JSONLogic might
            work better for you. If JSONLogic isn't expressive enough, or
            readability of JSONLogic becomes difficult, then MistQL will
            probably work better.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text--center">jq</h3>
          <p>
            jq is primarily used as a command-line tool rather than as an
            embeddable query language. Despite its ubiquity, jq doesn't have a
            robust, portable browser implementation, nor does it seem to be a
            major goal of the project. However, if your primary use case is as a
            CLI tool, jq is almost certainly your best bet, as it's a very
            well-known tool with a large amount of community support.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision criteria for whether to use jq or MistQL is very
            similar to the decision criteria for whether to use JMESPath or jq.
